## FAQs

### How it works:

***

There are eight possibilities of winning for both players. First I divided the HTML into eight sections based on the position of the Gameboard. I implemented the logic using JQoury and setting up conditions based on the length of each player's move. 

### favorite functions:

My favorite func is the game over, once one of the players won or both get equalized an alert shows a Gameover customized window.
